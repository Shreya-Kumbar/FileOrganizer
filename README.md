ðŸ“‚***File Organizer***-A python script that organizes files into folders by their types.<br><br>

ðŸ«§Turn your messy folder containing many different types of files into a neat and easy to nagivate folder.<br><br>

ðŸ“œ**How it works**:

1. Copy your folder location and paste it in source_folder. (for eg. your folder name is "K", so you paste the location of "K" (say loc_K) in source folder and it should look like-<br>
`source_folder = r"loc_K\K"`<br>
(added \K so it reads in the location of file, not just the desktop).<br><br>

2. Now just run all the cells once to ensure you have imported standard os and shutil to python database and you are done!<br><br>

ðŸ“œ**What it does**:<br>
 -Creates 3 folders named "Images", "Documents" and "Others" and puts all your files in those folders based on their types (like .jpg, .png, .jpeg will go into "Images" and .pdf, .txt, etc will go into "Documents" and so on).-
